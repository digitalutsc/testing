00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
It’s six o clock in the morning on the farm of Elton Woodside, near Clinton, Prince Edward Island.

00:36.000 --> 00:43.000
The first round of chores is done and now it’s time for Elton to do his paper route 

00:44.000 --> 00:49.000 
It’s no ordinary paper route, for he has to cover the entire Island province several times a week,

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
besides running a successful farm. He’s pilot, mechanic, and ground crew, all rolled up into one.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
He even built his own hangar.

01:04.000 --> 01:13.000
The dairy herd no longer pays any attention when he takes off from his field and flies over the neat maritime countryside to Charlottetown.

01:14.000 --> 01:28.000
He’s there in a matter of minutes to meet the newspaper truck at the airport

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
Bundles of the latest issue come aboard his plane

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
bound for the outlying parts of the small island.

01:38.000 --> 01:44.000
The papers must be well tied, for this is an air drop delivery service.

01:45.000 --> 01:52.000
Boys and men hired by the newspaper are waiting at selected points to pick up the bundles and deliver the copies to the subscribers doors.

01:53.000 --> 02:08.000
Rain or Shine, Woodside covers his route. Fishermen at the north end, Villagers at Hogg Island, Masqoosh and Port Hill get there morning papers not much later than the city people in Charlottetown.

02:09.000 --> 02:27.000
Brookside is probably the champion hand bombardier in the world. At any rate, he always wins the prize at local air meets in open competition.

02:28.000 --> 02:33.000
He can put package after package inside a twenty foot circle flying at 95 Miles an hour.

02:34.000 --> 02:44.000
Besides delivering papers, his airplane is always available for mercy flights. He’s raced the stork to the hospital plenty of times and taken doctors to outlying patients.

02:45.000 --> 02:51.000
Everybody on the island knows his plane, and he always has time to say hello or take a message free of charge.

02:52.000 --> 03:00.000
When winter blocks the roads and there’s not much work around the farm, he’s practically a full time airline, doing charter passenger flights.

03:01.000 --> 03:20.000
But this morning, the flying is over in an hour or two. by 8 o clock the papers are all delivered, and the aviator becomes a farmer once again.

03:21.000 --> 03:27.000
With all that rush he didn’t forget to pick up a bag of fertilizer at the airport. After all, this is Prince Edward Island,

03:28.000 --> 04:00.000
and there are potatoes to be looked after.
